# Dash DES export tool repo.  The app is meant to accept and remember user inputs and then extract the appropriate data into DES format

This project uses Dash (https://dash.plotly.com/) 

Documentation for Plotly can be found here:

No need to describe the how-to's here, the documentation will do a much better job.
